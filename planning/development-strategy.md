# Development and Strategy

## Project Overview

The Pokemon App is a lightweight application designed to fetch and display
random pokemons from an external API.

## Development Approach

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous programming techniques to
  handle API requests and data fetching.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide the project into distinct modules, each
  responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.
- **Modular Design**: Encapsulate related functionalities within modules to
  promote reusability and maintainability.
- **Code Organization**: Maintain a clear folder structure to organize different
  types of modules.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and
  catch potential bugs early in the development process.
- **Version Control**: Utilize a version control system like Git to track
  changes.
